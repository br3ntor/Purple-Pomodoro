# Purple-Pomodoro
Pomodoro timer for Free Code Camp.

[Check it out](https://br3ntor.github.io/Purple-Pomodoro/)

### Dev To Do:
    - Update CSS for moz and ms for input styling
    - Clean up JS a bit, maybe I can be more descriptive with my variable and function names
    - More responsive CSS maybe, consistency with CSS size units px, rem, etc.

### Dev Brainstorm:
    - Maybe an auto-play toggle so you have to start each new pom manually.
    - Is the order of the sounds good? Or should I switch them?
